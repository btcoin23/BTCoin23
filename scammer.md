He is a scammer who uses different github account and has done none of this work with perfection. We hired and did KYC with him but found out he got a fake KYC and also he did half the code and hacked wallet, later requested to join on project from a new account and doing the same things.

He is from Russia based on his IP address and he got 6 times his username changed on TG and have 4+ accounts. We are already taking legal actions against him
